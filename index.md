## Plethora

Plethora is a ComputerCraft peirpheral provider for Minecraft 1.8.9+. It aims to provide both metadata and peripherals
for most main-stream mods, in addition to vanilla Minecraft.

Plethora also adds a series of "modules" to the game. These modules can be used by the player with varying success.
They realy come in to their element when when put in a manipulator, providing a series of methods which allow
interacting with your environment. This includes:

 - Introspection: investigating the current player's inventory (and ender chest)
 - Scanner: scans blocks in an area, gathering metadata about them and allowing wrapping peripherals remotely
 - Sensor: scans entities in an area. Like the scanner this allows getting metadata and wrapping them as peripherals.
 - Frickin' laser beam. It fires lasers.

If you've ever wanted to embed a computer in your skull then today is your lucky day. Plethora provides a neural interface
which can be attached to your head, or some unsuspecting animal or monster. Right clicking the entity with a
neural controller allows you to interact with it. You can insert modules (which will be wrapped as peripherals) and
manipulate them with the built-in computer. Building a cyborg army has never been so easy.

You can also add a kinetic augment to the neural interface. This allows controlling the host entity in various ways.
